## Mount AWS S3 bucket into ECS (Elastic Container Service)

We will follow the following steps to mount S3 bucket into ECS container:

- Check which Linux distribution is running inside the container using command: 
    - `cat /etc/os-release`

- Check Linux architecture 
    - `uname -m`

- Choose the installation method from [Mount-S3](https://github.com/awslabs/mountpoint-s3/blob/main/doc/INSTALL.md) according to your Linux distribution and architecture

- We will install the mount-s3 on container startup and also launch our application (for example FAST API) in this case, so we are using `ENTRYPOINT(my_script.sh)` and entrypoint shell script will look something like this,

- Containers running in ECS by default does not have privileges to mount/demount the filesystem into container so in ECS task definition, we have to give them right privileges and also make sure that your task `ROLE must have right permissions to S3 bucket` otherwise you will get issues,

- Now, when you will launch your application, you will be able to see the S3 contents mounted into your container directory (where you have mounted).

- For testing purposes, you can follow the above steps directly into EC2 instance and launch the container in the EC2 using following docker command (you donâ€™t need explicit task definition here)
    - `docker run -it --cap-add SYS_ADMIN --device /dev/fuse -p <host_port>:<container_port>  <image_name>:<tag> /bin/bash`

- Replace the placeholder accordingly and you will enter into the container and now follow the steps to mount s3 directly into container as, (in my case, using debian-based distribution so installation is accordingly)

    - cat /etc/os-release (check linux distrubution)
    - uname -m  (check linux architecture e.g. x86_64)
    - apt update -y
    - wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/mountpoint-s3-release/latest/x86_64/mount-s3.deb
    - apt install ./mount-s3.deb -y
    - mount-s3 --version (verify installation)
    - add role with s3 access to EC2 instance
    - mkdir /home/mnt
    - mount-s3 s3fstest-bucket101 /home/mnt

- Now you have successfully mounted s3 into your container `/home/mnt` working directory and you can view the contents of you s3 bucket inside the container using `ls -la`
